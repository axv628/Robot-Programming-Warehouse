## Intermediate Submission
### **Due 12 March - 17:00**
#### Expected to submit the following:
* A breakdown of the overall assignment into roles/subsystems.
* A mapping from team members to roles/subsystems.
* For each subsystem where appropriate, a suite of JUnit tests which you expect the final subsystem to pass.
* A prototype implementation of each subsystem which can be run against the tests (but may fail all of them).
* One or more Git repositories which can be monitored to observe development progress.
* Ideally some demonstration of partial subsystem integration.
* Any additional documentation necessary to support your team's progress (e.g. notes on who has worked well to deadlines).

#### Additional Information
* 20 minutes long
* Split into demonstrations and individuals discussing their contributions to code

#### Objectives:
* **Robot Interface**
* Unreliable human:
* *Wrong number*
* *timeouts*
* Additional capabilites 
* **Route Excecution**

### Team 2
#### Objectives:
* **Job Selection**
* Cancellation prediction
* Take current location of robot into account
* Sharing jobs across robots rather than one job per robot
* **Multi Robot route planning**
* Multiple robots, avoiding collisions


### Team 3
#### Objectives :
* **Bluetooth Communication**
* Implement for multiple robots
* **Warehouse Interface**
* Robot plans and position updates
* **Localisation**
* Probalistic localisation using distance sensor

#### Next Meeting

* Tarun
* Om
* Will

#### What was discussed
* Meeting with TA
* Discussed performance for intermediate deadline (20/20)
* Discussed objectives for final week coming up to final warehouse submission.

##### Warehouse Interface

* List of previously completed jobs
* Know which robot is doing which job
* **Extension** Display robot's route/location

##### Robot Motion

* Rather than hardcoding turning value, alter algorithm so robot turns into line is found

##### Robot Interface

* **Optional** Show where robot is and what they're doing

##### Bluetooth

* Multiple threads for multiple robots
* Serialisation and de-serialisation

##### Route Excecution

* Look at problems that may arise and solve them before they happen i.e. robot losing line etc

##### Cancellation Prediction

* Prioritise over localisation
* Use any library available

#### **DEADLINE SET FOR NEXT MEETING**

#### Next Meeting
**20/03/2018 - 11:00**
##### Agenda
* Review progress of remaining tasks

### **15/03/2018**

* Anant
* Gintaré
* Tarun
* Om
* Will

#### What was discussed:
* Current progress
* Remaining tasks for last two days

##### Remaining tasks:
**Team 1**
* Fix robot motion, maybe slow robot down so junction and line detection are more accurate.

**Team 2**
* Multiple robot route planning, avoiding collisions
* Job auctioning

**Team 3**
* Finish warehouse interface, have the ability to cancel jobs on the robot through the interface.
